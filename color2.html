	<h1 class="Lord">	"Lord, being dark," I said, "I cannot bear
						The further touch of earth, the scented air;
						Lord, being dark, forewilled to that despair
						My color shrouds me in, I am as dirt
						Beneath my brother's heel; there is a hurt
						In all the simple joys which to a child
						Are sweet; they are contaminate, defiled
						By truths of wrongs the childish vision fails
						To see; too great a cost this birth entails.
						I strangle in this yoke drawn tighter than
						The worth of bearing it, just to be man.
						I am not brave enough to pay the price
						In full; I lack the strength to sacrifice
						I who have burned my hands upon a star,
						And climbed high hills at dawn to view the far.</h1>
